<h2>What Is MK‑677 (Ibutamoren)?</h2>
<p>MK‑677, also known as Ibutamoren, is a growth hormone secretagogue. It stimulates your body to release more growth hormone (GH) and IGF‑1. Those are key for muscle growth, fat loss, and better sleep. Swisschems offers a 10 mg capsule, 60-count version that is pure, lab-tested, and easy to swallow.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked Swisschems MK‑677</h2>
<p>I ordered my first bottle from <a href="https://swisschems.is/product/mk-677-ibutamoren-380mg-10mg-60-caps/ref/277/?campaign=github" target="_blank">Swisschems MK‑677</a>. I waited 5 days for delivery in Vilnius, and the package arrived sealed with a Certificate of Analysis (COA). I tested over 8 weeks, 25 mg per day split into two doses. I logged my weight, sleep quality, appetite, and workouts in a simple spreadsheet. I also gathered feedback from three gym buddies who used the same product concurrently.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Week 1–2:</strong> Mild increase in appetite. Sleep felt slightly deeper.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 3–4:</strong> Noticeable strength gains. Bench press up 5 kg. Lean muscle starting to appear.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 5–6:</strong> Better recovery. Less muscle soreness after leg day. Energy levels stayed high.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 7–8:</strong> Body fat dropped by 1%. Overall mood improved. Zero reported side effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end, I ranked Swisschems MK‑677 at the top among four brands I’ve tried. Lab purity was above 98% as per COA. My gym buddies reported similar gains.</p>
